👋 Hi, I’m @Chencen Tang, a data scientist with a background in applied mathematics from the University of Kent at Canterbury.

👀 I specialize in machine learning, computer vision, and NLP projects. My experience includes developing churn prediction models, real-time car detection systems, and text generative models using frameworks like AWS SageMaker and GPT-3.5 Turbo.

🌱 I'm continuously exploring advanced ML techniques and generative models to tackle real-world problems.

💞️ Open to collaborations in data science and AI-driven projects.
